## Database Setup

- Starting with a tool of your choice (you will could be using both a MySQL tool and/or a PostGres tool), create a local database.
- In said database, set up any tables you would need in order to create a todo database. This database should have users, todos, and any columns you might need for that information to be stored in the database.
- Add at least 5 rows to table(s) you have created using the desktop tools.
- Go back and look at your previous projects and see if you can create any databases that you could utilize for them.

## Let's start simple

- Now that you have a database setup, try to connect it to your existing backend.
- Create routes to access the needed data from the tables
