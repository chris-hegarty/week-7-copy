## Classwork

- Any projects you have yet to complete should be completed today.
- Continue working on your project from yesterday to catch up with where we are.
- If completed, look through the homework for your next steps.
- This project AND/OR another should be ready to deploy the end of next week
  - Bearing that in mind, for the group project, take your own version to allow for it to be hosted on a site of your own choosing as opposed to only one for the whole group.
